IMPORTANT: Please note that the GitHub token you shared in the chat should be revoked immediately for security reasons. Create a new token and use that instead.

For security reasons, I recommend creating a new token with these steps:

1. Go to GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
2. Revoke the existing token you shared
3. Generate a new token
4. Use the new token when prompted
